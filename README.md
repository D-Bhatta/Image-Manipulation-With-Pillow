# Image-Manipulation-With-Pillow

Image manipulation project implemented with Pillow, a PIL(Python Imaging Library) fork.

The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to the Python interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.

The aim of this project is to implement some of the features of Pillow on a set of images.
